<h1 align="center">Hello</h1>

<h3 align="center">I am a software engineer inspired by the intersection of technology, art, and people. </h3> <br/> 

<p>As a software architect and former engineering director, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to help build impactful products both as an individual contributor and as a leader. I've found that my passion lies in the intersection between both realms - as a technical contributor that can also make meaningful contributions to team oversight, technical strategy, and business direction. </p>
